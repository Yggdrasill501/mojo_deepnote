First get your authentication string and register at [Modular](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo), I storngly remcomend to read docs and [check exmaples](https://github.com/modularml/mojo) although you can just copy the Dockerfile and it should work(ofc. with the authentication string).

## What i did ?
1. Check the debian version
```
cat /etc/debian_version
``` 
2. Make sure it is in Dockerfile
```
From debian: 10.7
